                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an aspiring software engineer from London. During my gap year I have 
                    enrolled in a front end software engineering programme. After completing 
                    my bachelors degree, I hope to pursue a career within the tech industry. 
                    I speak English, Persian, Russian and Spanish which will be an asset when 
                    working with international clients.

                    <div class="question">Why have I chosen to do an apprenticeship?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The traditional university path certainly has its benefits but I am of the belief
                             that apprenticeships, particularly in the tech industry, can prove a superior 
                             route as you are given the opportunity to study and work simultaneously amongst 
                             professionals. With coding, I find that the best way to learn is through practice. 
                             Theory is crucial but application is invaluable. I hope to reap the benefits of both 
                             by  completing a degree apprentiship.

                    <div class="question">What can I contribute to the firm?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>My dedication and persistence. I am committed to my studies and my career. When I am met 
                            with a task, I do everything within my power to complete it to the highest of standards 
                            and continue learning and progressing as I go. An example of this is this website. I am 
                            coding this it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript just two months into beginning coding- just 
                            in time for my apprenticeship applications. I work well in a team setting and am confident 
                            I can bring a fresh and varied perspective to the firm.

                        <p>I want to use this apprenticeship as a foundation for my career in the tech industry. For the 
                            course of the apprenticeship I hope to pick up the relevant skills and connections that will 
                            let me progress in this field. I would be glad to have the opportunity to continue as a permanent 
                            employee at your firm. Besides work I also want to make a difference to my homeland- perhaps I 
                            will be able to do so with the use of modern technology.

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Halfway through Year 8 in secondary school, I began studying Russian independently. In Year 10,
                             I sat the GCSE and got a grade 9 (A**). I have now achieved an A* in the Russian  A-level. Next,
                              I decided to improve my native Persian. Through reading and contributing to blogs and following 
                              the works of more affluent speakers and writers, I can now proudly say that people often tell me 
                              my Persian sounds academic! I have a deep interest in expanding my knowledge of different languages 
                              and have now moved onto learning Spanish.
